# AI for Trading Nanodegree
## TERM 1: QUANTITATIVE TRADING
Learn the basics of quantitative analysis, from data processing and trading signal generation to portfolio management. Use Python to work with historical stock data, develop trading strategies, and construct a multi-factor model with optimization.

### Project 1: Trading with Momentum
In this project, you will learn to implement a momentum trading strategy and test if it has the potential to be profitable. You will work with historical data of a given stock universe and generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. You will then compute the signal and produce projected returns. Finally, you will perform a statistical test to conclude if there is alpha in the signal.

#### Course: Basic Quantitative Trading
In this course, you will learn about market mechanics and how to generate signals with stocks. Your first project is to develop a momentum trading strategy.
Lesson content
- Lesson 1: Introduction
- Lesson 2: Stock Prices
- Lesson 3: Market Mechanics
- Lesson 4: Data Processing
- Lesson 5: Stock Returns
- Lesson 6: Momentum Trading

### Project 2: Breakout Strategy
In this project, you will code and evaluate a breakout signal. You will run statistical tests to test for normality and to find alpha. You will also learn to find outliers and evaluate the effect that filtered outliers could have on your trading signal. You will run various scenarios of your model with or without the outliers and decide if the outliers should be kept or not.

#### Course: Advanced Quantitative Trading
In this course, you will get to know the workflow that a quant follows for signal generation, and also learn to apply advanced quantitative methods in trading.
Lesson content
- Lesson 1: Quant Workflow
- Lesson 2: Outliers and Filtering Signals
- Lesson 3: Regression
- Lesson 4: Time Series Modeling
- Lesson 5: Volatility
- Lesson 6: Pairs Trading and Mean Reversion

### Project 3: Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization
In this project, you will create two portfolios utilizing smart beta methodology and optimization. You will evaluate the performance of the portfolios by calculating tracking errors. You will also calculate the turnover of your portfolio and find the best timing to rebalance. You will come up with the portfolio weights by analyzing fundamental data, and by quadratic programming.

#### Course: ETFs, Indices, Stocks
In this course, you will learn about portfolio optimization, and financial securities formed by stocks such as market indices, vanilla ETFs, and Smart Beta ETFs.
Lesson content
- Lesson 1: Stocks, Indices and Funds
- Lesson 2: ETFs
- Lesson 3: Portfolio Risk and Return
- Lesson 4: Portfolio Optimization

### Project 4: Multi-factor Model
In this project, you will research and generate multiple alpha factors. Then you will apply various techniques to evaluate the performance of your alpha factors and learn to pick the best ones for your portfolio. You will formulate an advanced portfolio optimization problem by working with constraints such as risk models, leverage, market neutrality and limits on factor exposures.

#### Course: Multi-factor Model
In this course, you will learn about alpha factors and risk factors, and construct a portfolio with advanced portfolio optimization techniques.
Lesson content
- Lesson 1: Factors Models of Returns
- Lesson 2: Risk Factor Models
- Lesson 3: Alpha Factors
- Lesson 4: Advanced Portfolio Optimization with Risk and Alpha Factors Models

## TERM 2: AI ALGORITHMS FOR TRADING
Work with alternative data and use machine learning to generate trading signals. You will run a backtest to evaluate your signals and use advanced techniques to combine the top performing signals.

### Project 5: Sentiment Analysis using NLP
In this project, you will apply Natural Language Processing on corporate filings, such as 10Q and 10K statements, from cleaning data and text processing, to feature extraction and modeling. You will utilize bag-of-words and TF-IDF to generate company-specific sentiments. Based on the sentiments, you will decide which company to invest in, and the optimal time to buy or sell.

#### Course: Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing
In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of text processing and use them to analyze corporate filings and generate sentiment-based trading signals.

### Project 6: Deep Neural Networks with News Data
In this project, you will build deep neural networks to process and interpret news data. You will also play with different ways of embedding words into vectors. You will construct and train LSTM networks for sentiment classification. You will run backtests and apply the models to news data for signal generation.

#### Course Advanced Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
In this course, you will get to know how deep learning is applied in quantitative analysis and get to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) to generate trading signals.

### Project 7: Backtesting
In this project, you will construct open-high-low-close (OHLC) data feed and a backtesting framework. You will learn about various visualization techniques for backtesting. You will construct trading strategies using various parameters such as trade days, take profit levels, stop loss levels, etc. You will then optimize the parameters and evaluate the performance by analyzing the results of your backtests.

#### Course: Simulating Trades with Historical Data
In this course, you will learn to refine trading signals by running a rigorous backtest. You will know how to keep track of your P&L while your algorithm buys and sells.

### Project 8: Combine Signals for Enhanced Alpha
In this project, you will create a prediction model for S&P 500 and its constituent stocks by performing model selection for a large data set which includes market data, fundamental data and alternative data. You will validate your model to ensure there is no overfitting. You will rank and select stocks to construct a long/short portfolio based on the prediction results.

#### Course: Combining Multiple Signals
In this course, you will learn about advanced techniques to select and combine the factors that youâ€™ve generated from both alternative data and market data.
